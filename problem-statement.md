## Message Queue
We have to design a message queue supporting publisher-subscriber model. It should support following operations:

* It should support multiple topics where messages can be published.
* Publisher should be able to publish a message to a particular topic.
* Subscribers should be able to subscribe to a topic (Note: subscriber can subscribe to at most 1 topic).
* Whenever a message is published to a topic, all the subscribers, who are subscribed to that topic, should receive the message.
* Subscribers should be able to run in parallel
